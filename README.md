# Workout_diary
Django web app. Web page with workout progress is created. Web application consist of main page with overview of workouts, detail page of every workout listed and the contact form, which sends an email to the private email address, after which I am able to send a reply. 

Further, I would like to extend the web application by adding a view enabling managing of the the diary on the frontend.
